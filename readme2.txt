You may need to change paths for listAllFiles methods for FileClient and FileServer to whatever directory that you will run this program in

Can't figure out how to put two lists of files into one window

Download and Upload files are currently hard coded as I can't get ListView to work

Path of fxml file in Controller.java may also need to be changed

Run FileServer First then run FileClient
